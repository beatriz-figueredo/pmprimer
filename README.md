# PMPrimer Docker Image
A ready-to-use Docker image for PMPrimer â€” a Python-based tool for automated design and evaluation of multiplex PCR primer pairs across diverse DNA templates. This image provides an isolated and reproducible environment to run PMPrimer without the need for manual setup or dependency installation.

PMPrimer enables efficient primer design for applications such as pathogen detection, amplicon sequencing, and molecular diagnostics, especially for highly variable genomes.
